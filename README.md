cycle-ts-starter-kit
====================

This is a basic Starter Kit for a CycleJS App. Features:
* written in Typescript
* Universal / Isomorphic, served by Express
* Uses cycle-history

## This project is WIP
Right now I'm not completely satisfied with the whole Webpack / gulp build process. This needs to be improved.

Another task is to get hot reloading working.

## Note about Typings
The typings under src/tsd_typings are from [DefinitelyTyped](http://definitelytyped.org/).

The typings under src/typings I have written myself. They are Work In Progress.

My intention is to push them to DefinitelyTyped, and if the repository owners accept my PR's to add them to the original library repository. This would be compatible with DefinitelyTyped's possible successor: https://github.com/typings/typings
