- Get proper hot reloading working: https://github.com/Widdershin/cycle-restart
- Get serverside hot reloading
- Have TS output ES6. This doesn't really work right now because the server side
directly includes component/main/index.js so I'd have to run it through babel first
- SCSS
- Stop favicon from being requested every time
